This script can be used to download indexed top songs on http://mr-jatt.com and send them over to your dropbox account shared/unshared directory(no dropbox client need to be installed on OS). It checks if the song already downloaded, if not then executes. You dont have to worry about transferring to your cell phone as dropbox directory is sync'd to your phone, your playlist will be updated automatically.
