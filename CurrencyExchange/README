This script is used to get regular updates of exchange/currency rates via email and SMS on regular intervals via cronjob. 
I am using twilio to send SMS messages. So you will have to create your own twillio account and add the key inside the script.

1 7 * * * python /tmp/jsinix_xchange_email.py

Twilio can be installed by 'pip install twilio'
