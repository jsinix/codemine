This script is written to expidite the process of initial system configuration
(specifically Ubuntu). These initial things include basic setup, securing the
system(firewall), updating it etc. I have not tested this with any distro but
this can be modified to suit your need.Its preferrable you run this on new
system as it overwrite some files.

Should we start ?(y/n) y
