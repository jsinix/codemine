I wrote this script to create a database that contains the IP address and mask of all the devices that I manage. This will prove to very useful in situations where you manage a lot of devices and new interfaces are constantly been added(like in many big networks). This is two part solution. One of the script runs updates the database everyday when run in a cronjob. The other scrpit will just be a reader/front end to query this database.
